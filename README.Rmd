The `relic` package provides tools for working with version-controlled workflows,
in git repositories. It enables extracting and comparing files and objects from project history.
You can use `relic` for tasks such as

  - Pulling a file from a previous version of your code
  - Creating a report (or a GIF!) that shows the evolution of a model object or output over
    the course of repository development
  - Run code repeatedly at many points along repository history to compare outputs
    or performance.

`relic` has specific functionality for working with [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets-manual) projects. It works
especially well when used in conjunction with [cloud-based, versioned object storage](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/cloud-storage.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `relic` like so:

```r
install.packages("relic", repos = c("https://ecohealthalliance.r-universe.dev"))
```
